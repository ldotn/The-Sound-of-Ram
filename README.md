# The-Sound-of-Ram
Silly little program to play the memory space of a live process as sound on Windows

Just clone, compile (or not) and run. It just uses Windows API's , so no external dependencies. 
After opening it just write the PID of the process you want to listen to (you can get that value from the Task Manager), sit back and enjoy a good dose of fresh "ramcore", as I like to call it.

If you don't want to compile it for whatever reason, there's a precompiled version uploaded directly on the repo.
